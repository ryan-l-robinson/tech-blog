It’s especially nice when in situations like jumping between personal and work spaces of the same app, or multiple clients, or dev vs staging vs production servers. It’s a great way to quickly adjust what I’m thinking about, e.g. if I’m seeing yellow or purple or red, it immediately slows me down to be a lot more careful about what I’m c... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Drupal Dev Environment Updated: The DevContainer</title><link href="https://ryanrobinson.technology/websites/drupal/dev-env-updated-devcontainer/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Drupal Dev Environment Updated: The DevContainer" /><published>2024-04-08T11:46:00-04:00</published> <updated>2024-04-08T11:46:00-04:00</updated> <id>https://ryanrobinson.technology/websites/drupal/dev-env-updated-devcontainer/</id> <content src="https://ryanrobinson.technology/websites/drupal/dev-env-updated-devcontainer/" /> <author> <name>Ryan Robinson</name> </author> <category term="Websites" /> <category term="Drupal" /> <summary> This continues from a previous post about a new Drupal dev environment, a significant upgrade from some previous posts that you can find on the Drupal Docker tag. That covered the Dockerfiles, while this will cover changes to the Devcontainer.json and the postCreateCommand script. The whole project’s code can be found on my GitHub.

It was built on Oracle Linux, a requirement in that context, with three images for Apache, PHP, and MySQL. But there were some significant problems with it, first and foremost that it was very slow. So, this is another version, now based on one of the official Drupal images instead of the Oracle Linux ones. It can b... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Drupal: Open Menu</title><link href="https://ryanrobinson.technology/websites/drupal/open-menu/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Drupal: Open Menu" /><published>2024-02-21T17:44:00-05:00</published> <updated>2024-02-21T17:44:18-05:00</updated> <id>https://ryanrobinson.technology/websites/drupal/open-menu/</id> <content src="https://ryanrobinson.technology/websites/drupal/open-menu/" /> <author> <name>Ryan Robinson</name> </author> <category term="Websites" /> <category term="Drupal" /> <summary> In a previous related post, I wrote about some lessons in a co-design project of an open menu, with a video where we presented about it to the IDRC. That was mostly about the process and this is about the result: a header navigation page on a Drupal 9 site. The goal was to provide an overview of the same information that’s in the main navigation, but in a more accessible way for screen readers ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Dark Content Mode</title><link href="https://ryanrobinson.technology/websites/dark-content/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Dark Content Mode" /><published>2024-02-21T16:46:00-05:00</published> <updated>2024-02-21T16:46:00-05:00</updated> <id>https://ryanrobinson.technology/websites/dark-content/</id> <content src="https://ryanrobinson.technology/websites/dark-content/" /> <author> <name>Ryan Robinson</name> </author> <category term="Websites" /> <summary> In case you haven’t caught it yet, there’s new functionality coming to browsers for dark mode applied to content. This could come as a surprise to web developers who did not plan for dark mode in their design, but is overall a win for those of us who prefer dark mode on all the things all the time. It’s already become my default on Android Edge, inheriting that I have my device in dark mode. I... </summary> </entry> </feed>
